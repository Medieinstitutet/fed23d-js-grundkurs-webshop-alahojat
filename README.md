# Bowls by Baba

Bowls by Baba is hopefully the beginning of further showcasing the hidden treasures of my father's woodworking mastery. This assignment was a great opportunity for me to both aqcuire new skills as well as pay homage to my father's work. Each piece presented here is a testament to his unparalleled skill, encapsulating a legacy of artistry, precision, and dedication. It's not merely a display of products; it's a celebration of a his artistry that has fueled my own love for creativity.

## Lessons Learned

As a first time experience with Javascript, let alone a programming language, the lessons have been endless. Extremely challenging whilst simultaneously very rewarding. It has kept my mind and creativity occupied and now in hindsight, despite all the challenges, I have thoroughly enjoyed seeing the project come together.

My general takeaways ahead of future projects are as follow:
- always spend more time than initially planned on the initial research, planning and design part of any project
- ensure I have finished workflows ready before embarking on any type of code

Javascript specific lessons:
- ensure function/variable naming is more deliberate and adheres to a system/structure
- spend time on writing clear comments immediately after each code/section
